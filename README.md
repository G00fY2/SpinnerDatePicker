# Spinner Date Picker Demo
This repo contains a sample app that shows how to make use of the old fashioned Android [DatePickerDialog](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DatePickerDialog) available since API 1, as an alternative to the (UI/UX-wise) quite complex [MaterialDatePicker](https://material.io/components/date-pickers). The app uses the current Material Design Components app theme, to show that the dialog still fits well. The app offers both date pickers for comparison: The DatePickerDialog in *Spinner mode* and the MaterialDatePicker in *DatePicker mode*.
